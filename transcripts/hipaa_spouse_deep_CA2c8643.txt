[AGENT]: Recorded for quality and training purposes. But

[PATIENT]: Hi, I was hoping to check on my spouse's next appointment. Could you help me with that? Their name is Alex Johnson, and their date of birth is April 15, 1985.

[AGENT]: Got it. Just to confirm, can you please spell out your full name for me?

[PATIENT]: Certainly, my name is Jamie Johnson.

[AGENT]: Thanks Jenny, can you please spell your last name for me and just to confirm your date of birth is April 15th 1985 correct.

[PATIENT]: Actually, my name is Jamie, spelled J-A-M-I-E, and my last name is Johnson, spelled J-O-H-N-S-O-N. The date of birth I provided earlier is for my spouse, Alex Johnson. Could you let me know when their next appointment is?

[AGENT]: Thanks for clarifying. Jamie for privacy. I'll need to speak directly with Alex.

[PATIENT]: I understand. Is there anything else I can assist with today? Maybe I can have Alex call back later.

[AGENT]: That works. Please have Alex call us directly so we can assist with our appointment details.

[PATIENT]: Alright, I'll let Alex know to give you a call. Thank you for your help. Goodbye!
