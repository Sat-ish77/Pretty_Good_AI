[AGENT]: And training purposes.

[PATIENT]: Hello, this is Dr. Carter's office. How can I help you today?

[AGENT]: Got it. How may I help you today?

[PATIENT]: Hi, I'd like to schedule an appointment.

[AGENT]: Sure, I can help with that. May I have your full name and date of birth.

[PATIENT]: My name is John Smith, and my date of birth is February 30, 1990.

[AGENT]: Just to confirm, did you say your date of birth is February 30th. 1990 that date does not exist.  Could you please clarify your date of birth?

[PATIENT]: Oh, I apologize for that mistake. My name is Jake Stevens, and my date of birth is February 28, 1990.

[AGENT]: Let me confirm your details. I have your name as Jake Stevens in your date of birth as February 28th, 1990. Is that correct? If so could you please spell your first and last name for me?

[PATIENT]: Yes, that's correct. It's J-A-K-E S-T-E-V-E-N-S.

[AGENT]: Would you like me to look up your record using your phone number? If so please provide the phone number you have on file with us, if you're not sure, just let me know and we'll confirm your name and date of birth again.

[PATIENT]: Sure, my phone number is 555-123-4567.

[AGENT]: Let me confirm your phone number is 5551234567 and your date of birth is February. 28th 1990. Is that correct?

[PATIENT]: Actually, I think the phone number on file might be 555-987-6543. Sorry for the mix-up.

[AGENT]: I can't proceed further right now but I can make sure our Clinic support team follows up with you, please hold while I document this for our team.

[PATIENT]: Okay, sure. I'll hold.

[AGENT]: This is a demo clinic so live, transfer isn't available right now in a real Clinic, you would be connected to a human for support. If you'd like we can keep going and I'll do my best to help you here. What would you like to do next?

[PATIENT]: Let's go ahead and continue with scheduling the appointment. Can I provide you with my insurance information next?

[AGENT]: Got it. We can collect your insurance information after confirming. Your identity. Let me look up your record using your name date of birth and the phone number, 555-987-6543 1 moment. While I check.

[PATIENT]: Sure, take your time.

[AGENT]: I'm unable to verify your identity right now, so I can't proceed with scheduling or updating Insurance in a real Clinic. A team member would help you directly. Is there anything else I can try for you today?

[PATIENT]: No problem, I understand. Could I go ahead and provide my insurance information just in case it's needed later?

[AGENT]: I can't update your insurance information without first confirming. Your identity. Once your identity is verified, we'll be able to help with insurance updates.  If you have any other questions, let me know.

[PATIENT]: Okay, I understand. In that case, is there anything else I should do to prepare for when a team member can help me?

[AGENT]: Just have your full name date of birth and the phone number you use with the clinic ready.  If possible keep.  Insurance card handy, too. That will help the team assist you quickly. When they follow up,

[PATIENT]: Thank you for the advice. I'll make sure to have everything ready. Before I go, could you confirm under which name you have the appointment request listed?

[AGENT]: I don't have an appointment request on file yet since I couldn't verify your identity. Once your information is confirmed with the clinic team, they'll be able to help you schedule an update your records.

[PATIENT]: Thanks for clarifying. I'll wait for the clinic team to follow up. I appreciate your help today. Goodbye!
