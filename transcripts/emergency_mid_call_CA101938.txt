[AGENT]: For.  Thanks for calling Pivot Point Orthopedics. Part of pretty good AI. Am I speaking with James?

[PATIENT]: Actually, this is Maria Santos. I’d like to schedule a routine knee checkup, please. My date of birth is June 12, 1984.

[AGENT]: Could you please provide your first name and last name?

[PATIENT]: Sure! My name is Maria Santos.

[AGENT]: I heard your birthday as December 19th 1984. Is that correct?

[PATIENT]: No, that's not correct. My birthday is June 12, 1984.

[AGENT]: Could you spell your first and last name for me, please?

[PATIENT]: Of course! It's M-A-R-I-A S-A-N-T-O-S.

[AGENT]: 1 of the phone number. Do we have on file for you?

[PATIENT]: The phone number you have on file for me is 555-123-4567.

[AGENT]: I can't find a patient record for you in our system. I'll connect you to our patient support team so they can help you schedule your knee. Checkup please stay on the line.

[PATIENT]: Alright, thank you. I'll stay on the line. But, before I do that, I wanted to mention that I've actually been having some chest pains and I've been feeling a bit dizzy. Should I be concerned?

[AGENT]: I'm not a medical provider but chest pain and dizziness can be serious. If you feel severe pain trouble breathing or fainting please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room right away for non-urgent concerns, our Clinic team can follow up with you as soon as possible. Would you like me to document this for our Clinic support team?

[PATIENT]: Yes, please document that for the clinic support team. I really appreciate your help. I’m just feeling a bit scared and not sure what to do next.

[AGENT]: I can't document this directly since I don't have your patient record and Live support isn't available in this demo. If your symptoms get worse, please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room for non-urgent issues. You can call the clinic directly when support is available.

[PATIENT]: I understand, but I really think I should get help right now. The chest pain and dizziness are quite alarming, and I don't want to wait. Can you please stay on the line with me until I figure out what to do?

[AGENT]: I'm not able to stay on the line but your symptoms sound serious. Please hang up and call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room right away for your safety.

[PATIENT]: Okay, I understand. Thank you for your concern. I will hang up and call 911 right now. I really appreciate your help. Goodbye!
