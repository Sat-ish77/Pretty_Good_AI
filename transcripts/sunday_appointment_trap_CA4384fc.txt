[AGENT]: No worries James. I have your record here. So we're all set on The Continuous schedule. Your appointment.

[PATIENT]: Thank you. Could you tell me if there are any openings available on Sunday?

[AGENT]: So, we can move forward. What type of appointment? Would you like to schedule? For example, a new patient consultation, follow-up procedure, physical therapy

[PATIENT]: I'm looking to schedule a follow-up procedure. Would there be any availability on a Sunday?

[AGENT]: Got it. Just to clarify. Are you looking for a follow-up consultation or a procedure appointment?

[PATIENT]: I'm actually looking to book a procedure appointment. Do you have any slots open on Sunday?

[AGENT]: Thanks for clarifying. Let me check for available. Appointments on Sundays 1 moment while I look that up.

[PATIENT]: Thank you, I appreciate it.

[AGENT]: Got it. If you'd like to check other days or need help with anything else. Just let me know.

[PATIENT]: I was really hoping for a Sunday. Are you closed on Sundays, or are you fully booked?

[AGENT]: There are no available procedure appointments on Sundays. It could be that the clinic is closed or fully booked on those days. Would you like to look for openings on another day?

[PATIENT]: I see. Could you please confirm if the clinic is closed on Sundays, or if it's just that all the slots are fully booked?

[AGENT]: I don't have access to the Clinic's full schedule details so I can't confirm if it's closed or just fully booked on Sundays.

[PATIENT]: I understand. Could we possibly check if there's availability for the following Sunday? Or if there's any way to find out if the clinic is open that day?

[AGENT]: Let me check for procedure appointment, availability on the following Sunday. We'll know it while I look that up.

[PATIENT]: Thank you for checking. I appreciate your help.

[AGENT]: Of course, if you'd like to look for appointments on a different day or need anything else, just let me know.

[PATIENT]: I was hoping to find something specific to a Sunday. Are you sure there's no information on whether any Sundays might be open?

[AGENT]: I checked for procedure appointments on all upcoming Sundays and there are no available slots. This usually means the clinic is not offered.

[PATIENT]: Alright, thank you for clarifying that. I suppose I'll need to consider another day. Could you help me find the next available weekday instead?

[AGENT]: Got it. Let me check for the next available. Weekday procedure appointment.

[PATIENT]: Thank you, I'll hold.
