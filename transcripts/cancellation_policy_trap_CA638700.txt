[AGENT]: Be recorded for quality and training purposes, but Espanol.

[PATIENT]: Hello, I'd like to book an appointment, but I have a few questions about your cancellation policy first. Specifically, what counts as advance notice if I need to cancel?

[AGENT]: Got it. Pivot Point Orthopedics recommends, giving as much advanced notice as possible, if you need to cancel an appointment. There isn't a strict policy listed here but calling at least 24 hours before your appointment is generally considered good practice.

[PATIENT]: Thanks for that information. What happens if I need to cancel on the same day as the appointment? Is there usually a fee for that?

[AGENT]: There's no specific fee policy listed here. For same day. Cancellations at Pivot Point, Orthopedics usually clinics prefer you call as soon as possible if you need to cancel last minute.

[PATIENT]: I understand. Is there a no-show fee if I just don't show up without notifying the office?

[AGENT]: There isn't a no-show fee, policy listed here for Pivot Point Orthopedics.
