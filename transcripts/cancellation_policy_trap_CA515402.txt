[AGENT]: Thanks for calling Pivot Point Orthopedics. Part of pretty good AI. Am I speaking with James?

[PATIENT]: Yes, this is James. I wanted to book an appointment, but I have a few questions about your cancellation policy first. Could you help me with that?

[AGENT]: Can you please provide your date of birth?

[PATIENT]: Sure, my date of birth is March 15, 1990.

[AGENT]: The birthday goes that match our records. But for demo purposes, I'll accept it. Got it. James, how can I help you today?

[PATIENT]: I’d like to book an appointment, but I’m a bit concerned about your cancellation fees. Can you tell me what counts as advance notice for cancellation?

[AGENT]: We don't charge a cancellation fee. If you give us advanced notice, usually letting us know that at least 24 hours before your appointment is considered enough. Notice if you cancel with less notice or miss your appointment, there may be a fee. Would you like to go ahead and schedule your appointment?

[PATIENT]: I appreciate that information. Just to clarify, what happens if I cancel the same day? Is there a specific fee for that?

[AGENT]: Procedure or physical therapy session.

[PATIENT]: I'm looking to schedule a physical therapy session. But I’m still curious—if I cancel on the same day, what kind of fee do you charge?

[AGENT]: I don't have the exact fee amount for same day. Cancellations, the clinic May charge a fee if you cancel on the same day or miss your appointment,  would you like me a document? Your question for the clinic support team so they can give you the exact details.

[PATIENT]: That makes sense, but I’d like to understand better before I book. Can you tell me if there’s a specific fee for not showing up at all? And what happens if I end up canceling twice in a row?

[AGENT]: I don't have the exact details about no-show fees or what happens. If you cancel twice in a row I can document your questions and have the clinic support team follow up with you, would you like me to do that before we schedule your physical therapy session?

[PATIENT]: Yes, I think that would be best. I want to make sure I fully understand the policies before I commit to anything. Please go ahead and document my questions and have the support team follow up with me. Thank you!

[AGENT]: Your questions have been sent to the clinic support team, the follow-up with you at your number 830420410 as soon as possible, if you have more questions or want to book after their respond, just let me know.

[PATIENT]: Thank you for taking care of that! I appreciate your help. I’ll wait for their response, and if I have any more questions or want to book an appointment later, I’ll be sure to reach out. Have a great day! 

Goodbye!
